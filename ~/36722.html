The ore is often brown, iron-stained rock or massive white Quartz, and usually contains only minute traces of gold. To extract the gold, the ore is crushed, then the gold is separated from the ore by various methods.

                            Gold quartz is formed when both natural gold and quartz combine in a molten state and are untouched by erosion. Sometimes, when they solidify, the quartz is white with a rare gold dispersion; when this happens, an exquisite piece of jewelry can be created. The white quartz rock is cut into slabs to expose the veins of gold.

                            Apr 25, 2017 · Quartz is extracted from open pit mines. Miners only use explosives on rare occasions when they need to expose a deep seam of quartz. The reason for this is that although quartz is known for its hardness, it damages easily if it is suddenly exposed to a change in temperature, such as that caused by a blast.

"Placer" gold deposits are created after erosion has broken the gold away from the lode and deposited it elsewhere. There are different kinds of placer deposits.
