                            Shortwall mining – A coal mining method that accounts for less than 1% of deep coal production, shortwall involves the use of a continuous mining machine with moveable roof supports, similar to longwall. The continuous miner shears coal panels 150–200 feet wide and more than a half-mile long, depending on other things like the strata of the .

                            The number of U.S. longwall faces reached 18 by 1966. However only eight remained in continuous production throughout the 1960s and U.S. mining companies viewed longwall mining as having a mixed record of success. Longwall mining still accounted for only 0.4 percent of the total underground coal production (Barczak, 1993).

                            Longwall mining is a highly productive underground coal mining technique. Longwall mining machines consist of multiple coal shearers mounted on a series of self-advancing hydraulic ceiling supports. The entire process is mechanized. Longwall mining machines are about 800 feet (240 meters) in width and 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) tall.

                            Room-and-pillar mining with retreat removes 80% to 90% of the coal. With longwall mining, continuous mining machines are used to set up the work areas for 1,000-foot-wide panels of coal that extend 10,000 feet or more in length.
