                            Anyone know the fate of Mattison? - Practical Machinist
                            Aug 30, 2007 · I heard from a grinding wheel salesman that Mattison was killed by a lawsuit. I'm curious if that was the case, or whether they went under for other reasons. I just bought a 36 X 120 inch Mattison surface grinder, and it certainly is a HUMBLING machine to look at. I was thinking I had some big tools, but in comparison, they're toys.
