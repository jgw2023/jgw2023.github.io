                            An unexpected discovery was made a few years ago in an aluminum mine in Turkey. High in the Ilbir Mountains of southwestern Anatolia, miners in a bauxite mine found a transparent diaspore mineral that was not only gem quality, but was color changing. Since this phenomenon occurs in less than one percent of gemstones, it was a real discovery.

                            Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, followed by China. In 2017, China was the top producer of aluminium with almost half of the world's production, followed by Russia, Canada, and India. Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.
