                            Application and working principle of jig plant_FAQS_
                            Jigs make use of density differentials, as do their DMS counterparts, but use water as the separation media, thus eliminating the need for the media-densification circuit completely. Tuckey estimates that capex saving of the jig over the DMS is about 30%, while providing greatly-reduced operating costs.

                            HMS and DMS are acronyms for Heavy (Dense) Medium Separation and is applied to the process of pre-concentration of minerals – mainly the production of a high weight, low assay product, which may be rejected as waste. In principle it is the simplest of all gravity processes and is a standard laboratory method for separating minerals of different specific gravity.
