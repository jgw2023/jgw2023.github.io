                            Gyratory crushers can accept 8–10% moisture in operation, but the fine content should be preferably less than 10%. The crushing action in gyratory crushers is regarded as rings or 'helics' (spirals) of feed down through the crusher of which a single section may be regarded as similar to the jaw crusher.
