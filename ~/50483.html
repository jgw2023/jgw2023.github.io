                            Feb 25, 2011 · KMG and the KMG clones. The kit DIY grinders (The EERF Grinder, Grinder In A Box, and No Weld Grinder) are nice if you are on a budget like myself. It allowed my to buy what I could afford at the time and spread the cost out over a few months and you end up with a solid affordable grinder that is almost as good as the ready made ones.
