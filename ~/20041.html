(continued below) Many of the children are so young. I can't imagine children of this age being in a factory mill, much less working there. I bet many died at an early age.

                            A cotton mill is a building housing spinning or weaving machinery for the production of yarn or cloth from cotton, an important product during the Industrial Revolution in the development of the factory system.. Although some were driven by animal power, most early mills were built in rural areas at fast-flowing rivers and streams using water wheels for power.
