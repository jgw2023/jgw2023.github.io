                            Phosphate rock deposits can be sedimentary or igneous, but more than 80 percent of the world's current production of phosphate rock is mined from sedimentary deposits formed by deposition of phosphate-rich materials in marine environments. Large sedimentary deposits are located in China, the Middle East, northern Africa and the United States.
