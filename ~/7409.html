The Sun Crusher was a nearly indestructible craft that was no larger than a starfighter, but was capable of unleashing destruction on a magnitude that dwarfed even the Death Star's capabilities. Unlike the Death Star, which destroyed individual planets, the Sun Crusher could destroy an entire star system by causing its target star to turn into a supernova.

We recommend a 4" to 6" gravel base of either 3/4" stone also called 57's by some or crusher run.

Although quarries price gravel on a per-ton basis, its simpler to calculate gravel needs and compare costs based on cubic yards.
