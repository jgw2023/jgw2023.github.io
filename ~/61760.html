                            One of the significant benefits of a VSI, when compared to a cone crusher, is the shape of the finished particle, which is typically more cubical and uniform when compared to a cone crusher product. REMco VSI discharge grading is finer than cone crusher gradings when operating in closed circuit.

                            If crushers that used pressure force is used then it results in unpredictable and even more uneven, jagged shape particles. Therefore, use of VSI crusher results in more cubical and even shapes particles. This is so, because vertical shaft impactor crusher utilizes the velocity force that is applied evenly to the surface and the mass of rock.

                            A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

                            Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them. Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic. An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).
