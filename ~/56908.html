                            Ball Mill Operation. Ball mills ride on steel tires or supported on both ends by trunnions. Girth gears bolted to the shell drive the mill through a pinion shaft from a prime mover drive. The prime movers are usually synchronized motors. During rotation, a portion of the charge is lifted along the inside perimeter.
