                            Copper Refining: From Ore to Market | INN
                            Copper refining requires putting mined rock through several processing stages. Here's an overview of how that happens. Mined rock typically contains less than 1 percent copper. That means that .

                            Copper levels in source water are typically very low. Although there are treatment technologies that can remove copper efficiently at the treatment plant, municipal treatment is not generally an effective strategy. This is because copper is an acceptable material for service lines and plumbing systems.
