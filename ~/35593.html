                            Grinding wheels and cut-off wheels are covered in abrasive grit and used for grinding, cutting, and machining applications. Grinding wheels remove material from metal, glass, wood, brick, or concrete. Cut-off wheels cut or notch these surfaces. Wheels are used with power tools and industrial machines such as angle grinders or bench grinders.

                            Throughout the grinding wheel's history, the bond that holds the abrasive grains together has proven as important as the grains themselves. The success of grinding wheels began in the early 1840s, when bonds containing rubber or clay were introduced, and by the 1870s a bond with a vitrified or glass-like structure was patented.
