                            Highlights Worldwide gold recovery on activated carbon grew from zero to almost 70% in twenty years from 1980. The stellar attributes of carbon gold plants led to complacency in the industry in designing and operating these plants. Most CIP and CIL plants are overdesigned and operated sub-optimally. Optimum design criteria and operating conditions are easily determined with simple test work .

                            Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process, a cyanide solution, or lixiviant, is percolated through ore contained in vats, columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.
