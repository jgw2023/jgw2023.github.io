Since 2007, the underground coal production has surpassed that from surface mining again 4. From 1880 to 1920, coal ranked first in the value of Arkansas' mineral and fuel output, but since 1922 the value of oil has exceeded that of coal.

                            Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine – a pit, and the .

                            Mining. Coal is mined by both surface or 'opencut' (or opencast) and underground or 'deep' mining methods, depending on the local geology of the deposit. Underground mining currently accounts for about 60 per cent of world coal production but around 80 per cent of Australia's coal .

                            Coal mining in the United Kingdom dates back to Roman times and occurred in many different parts of the country. Britain's coalfields are associated with Northumberland and Durham, North and South Wales, Yorkshire, the Scottish Central Belt, Lancashire, Cumbria, the East and West Midlands and Kent.After 1970, coal mining quickly collapsed and had practically disappeared by the 21st century.
