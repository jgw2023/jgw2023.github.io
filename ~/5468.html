                            Talcum powder (also known as baby powder) is made of talc, a mineral consisting of magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. Talc is obtained through mining mineral deposits, which are often inter-mingled with deposits of a type of asbestos known as asbestiform tremolite.Asbestos is most dangerous when it is friable, meaning that it is powdery or crumbles easily, producing tiny inhalable fibers.
