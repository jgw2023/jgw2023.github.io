                            Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid state welding process. It is different from fusion welding process and also different from other old solid welding process. It is a way of joining materials without melting them. No melting occurs during friction stir welding. There is no solidification shrinkage when the joined sections solidify. The temperature is lower than fusion welding.

                            Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining process that uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the workpiece material. Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material, which leads to a softened region near the FSW tool.

                            CNC milling is a specific form of computer numerical controlled (CNC) machining. Milling itself is a machining process similar to both drilling and cutting, and able to achieve many of the operations performed by cutting and drilling machines. Like drilling, milling uses a rotating cylindrical cutting tool.
