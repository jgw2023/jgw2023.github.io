                            When a good number of coarse aggregate fragments (all more than 6.35 mm in diameter) are held together by a cementing material, their behavior towards the imposed loads is just like a very strong rock mass. Gravel and crushed stone are commonly used for this purpose. Function of Water. Water is the main component of the concrete mix.

                            TYPES OF LIGHT WEIGHT AGGREGATES NATURAL AGGREGATE. PUMICE - Pumice is the most widely used of the natural lightweight aggregates. It is a porous, froth-like volcanic glass which is usually white-gray to yellow in color, but may be red, brown, or even black. SCORIA - Scoria is a vesicular glassy volcanic rock.

Diatomite is also something used as the aggregate component of lightweight concretes. The advantage to these types of aggregate is that they often do not require processing apart from crushing or screening.
