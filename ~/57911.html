                            Ethiopia: Ethiopia has failed to meet its cement export target for the 2017 – 2018 financial year that ended on 7 July 2018. It planned to raise US 42m in revenue from cement exports, according to Cement and Related Industry Research Development Technology Director Simegn Degu, who was quoted by the Ethiopian Herald newspaper.

                            Pile driving is often a cost-effective and time-efficient method of driving support posts (piles) into the earth. But because you're working with soil and other hidden features in the earth, there is an element of the unknown, and things don't always go as planned. Whether you are driving concrete, steel, or wood piles, any number of problems are common.

                            Oct 01, 2009 · I am curious as to how these values were arrived at. I have found literature on the skin friction (or unit rock socket side shear capacity) to use for drilled concrete piles in bedrock, but not pre-drilled and then driven piles. Is there any load test data for this type of installation? Is there any design literature? Comments appreciated.

                            Structural Capacity of Pile - civil-engg-world
                            When a pile is fully embedded in soil with undrained shear strength greater than 10 KN/m 2, the axial carrying capacity of it should not be limited by its strength as long column.If the soil is weak ( undrained shear strength less than 10 KN/m 2), it should be examine whether the shaft would behave as a long column.Where buckling may occur, its structural strength should be decreased to .
