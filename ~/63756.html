                            These tumblers are called "ball mills" because rock is placed in the tumbler with heavy steel balls. When the tumbler barrel turns the balls are lifted up the wall of the barrel until gravity causes them to drop down onto the ore, crushing it into tiny particles. The largest of these tumblers can process hundreds of tons of ore at a time.
