                            The two most commonly used crushers are the primary impact crushers and the heavy-duty jaw crushers. Before making any final decision, consider the characteristics of these two crushing machines: Primary Impact Crusher – A primary impact crusher is generally used for crushing materials of grain size and for recycling concrete and quarried .

                            Impact Crushers are available in stationary, track, and portable configurations meeting any demand for any of these industries. Although Impact Crushers generally have a higher operating cost than other crushers, they tend to produce a more uniform particle shape (cubical) which is desirable and produce more fines for hot asphalt producers.

                            Impact crushers provide better grain-size distribution of RA for road construction purposes, and they are less sensitive to material that cannot be crushed, such as steel reinforcement. Generally, jaw and impact crushers exhibit a large reduction factor, defined as the ratio of the particle size of the input to that of the output material.

Primary impact crushers are generally used in nonabrasive applications and where the production of fines is not a problem. Of all primary crushers, the impactor is the crusher that gives the best cubical product.

The material is contained within a cage, with openings on the bottom, end, or side of the desired size to allow pulverized material to escape. There are two types of impact crushers: horizontal shaft impactor and vertical shaft impactor.

                            In a vertical shaft impact crusher, the aggregate feed is introduced into a shoe or pump spinning on a vertical axis. The aggregate feed is thrown centrifugalLY against a series of anvils, pockets of aggregate particles (i.e., autogenous), or a combination thereof. Vertical shaft impact crushers produce a small reduction ratio and arc often used for crushing tines.
