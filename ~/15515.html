                            In a Hardgrove test, samples are crushed to a specified size, air-dried, and weighed, then run through a laboratory grinding (milling) machine for 60 grinds (rotations). The milled sample is then placed on a sieve of set specifications. The amount of sample that passes through the sieve is used to calculate the Hardgrove grindability index.

                            The Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) is a measure of coal's resistance to crushing. Grinding studies, and the resulting HGI, allow many different types of coal users to evaluate how coals will perform in their mills, allowing them to estimate grinding power requirements and throughput capacities.

                            The Bond Ball Mill Grindability test is designed to give a measure of the grinding characteristics of a material by finding the amount of size reduction resulting from a controlled energy input. Ball Mill Grindability of a material depends upon its hardness, structure, the manner in which it is fractured. The grindability is useful in evaluating power requirements for grinding.

Heterogeneity in procured coal with varying percentages of combustible and non-combustible material brings another challenge to the coal consumer that is to continuously measure the resistance of coal to crushing. The measure of grindability can be obtained by using Hard Grove Grindability Index (HGI).
