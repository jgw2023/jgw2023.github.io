                            The type of jet mill we use generates a distribution that is "stacked" towards the coarse end and does not create a large amount of, sometimes unwanted, fine material. If the fine particles generated are a concern we can use a secondary air classification step to remove those particles.

                            Air classifier - Wikipedia
                            An air classifier is an industrial machine which separates materials by a combination of size, shape, and density.. It works by injecting the material stream to be sorted into a chamber which contains a column of rising air.Inside the separation chamber, air drag on the objects supplies an upward force which counteracts the force of gravity and lifts the material to be sorted up into the air.
