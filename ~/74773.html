                            Mar 12, 2011 · SMALL CNC lathe - chucker vs. gang I'd like to start out with something small and simple, so I've been trying to learn a little bit about what is out there. I am leaning toward a machine that uses gang tooling as I really like the idea of a machine that has less potential for problems.
