                            Dirt Cheap 2 x 72 Belt Grinder Build - DIY Knifemaker's .
                            OK, I love belt grinders just as much as the next person, but it's a tough outlay of cash to get into a new grinder. Many folks have asked me about building my variable speed grinder 2 x 72" and lots have used the basic design successfully. That's awesome and thank you for your comments, but can one make a grinder for "dirt cheap?"
