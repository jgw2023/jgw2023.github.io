                            how do you reverse rotation direction on grinder .
                            Re: how do you reverse rotation direction on grinder Thomas, If it is already rotating clockwise, That is the what you want. Most bench griders run counterclockwise. You want the knife to be pulled away from you instead of toward you like the counterclockwise. Some motors can not be rewired to run backwards sort of speaking.

                            Nov 10, 2017 · A few years ago I built a KMG copy 2x72" belt grinder. It works fine except I would like to control the speed. I was looking at some VFDs and 3PH motors and wonder if it would be a good choice. Would 2 HP be enough power. 2 HP, 36 RPM, WEG Motor with 2 HP.

                            What type of motors do grinders typically use and why?
                            Below is the data on grinders I've tried. Almost all Italian manufacturers use 1/2 HP motors for the 60mm to 70mm flats and 3/4 HP to 1 HP for 80 to 90 flats; but they are all over the map for conicals. DC motors have more torque for a given wattage, and may be the ticket for grinding one dose at a time -- this is why you see them on home grinders.

                            Should a 1/3 hp bench grinder with a 1725 rpm motor have approximately twice the torque of a 1/3 hp bench grinder with a 3450 rpm motor? I asked this in the middle of another thread but I think it got buried. I'm asking because I've seen a 1/3 hp 6" 1725 rpm bench grinder.
