                            The lubrication of Gyratory crushers may be one of the special problems that the Jaw crusher isn't as readily exposed to. This crusher, because it may be loaded from two sides, often is used in an open pit situation where large ore carriers are dumping directly into the crusher. This means that the machinery is exposed to whatever climate it is being operated in.
