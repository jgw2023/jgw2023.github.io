                            Cationic Bitumen Emulsions contains cationic emulsifiers which are stabilized using strong acids like HCl under very low pH. Most of the natural and synthetic thickeners are not stable on this pH and disintegrate within hours of addition causing sharp fall in viscosity.

                            Acid Thickener is a cationic surfactant that was originally designed to thicken hydrochloric acid, which it does very effectively on its own; however, when used in combination with sodium chloride (salt), it will thicken a variety of acid systems including phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrofluoric, citric, oxalic, etc.

                            Apr 28, 2011 · Quats (also known as cationic surfactants) and cationic polymers remain on the hair via electrostatic interactions. These ingredients are positively charged when placed in a solution of water. They are attracted to the negatively charged, damaged protein sites on the hair. This positive/negative interaction prevents them from being removed.

Hard quats were those products that were incompatible with anionic surfactants. On the other hand, soft quats were defined as those quats that formed thick, clear, high-foaming

                            Due to its simplicity and accuracy, titration is a great fit for determining the active components in anionic and cationic surfactants. In this method, the cationic or anionic surfactant is simply titrated with its counterpart. In other words, cationic surfactants are titrated with anionic surfactants and vice versa.

                            Quaternary conditioners are special cationic surfactants (quaternary ammonium compounds) carrying positive electrical charges, thereby neutralizing the negative charges of the hair that occur especially on areas where there is weathering. The effect is a reduction of static electricity on the hair and the 'fly away' associated with it.
