Last week I had a student make a jewelry box and showed him how to mill out the inside of a solid block for the body. A lot of kids watched so it might get more use for woodworking now!! Cheers, Jim

                            Cutting a log with my sawmill After I built my mini sawmill I obtained a piece of a firewood log from a neighbour. I would really prefer longer pieces, but the nice thing about this chunk was that it was easier to carry into my basement. I made some "cradles" to place the log onto so that it would not roll to the side.

                            I'm sawing bass wood 1x3's here. See how narrow the kerf is when using a band saw (about 1/32")? For each 1/32" of kerf, you loose 2% of lumber out of the log to sawdust. Circular saw blades, and chain saw chains make up to about 9/32" kerf. It's easy to see the huge savings of a band saw!! The engine is a 13 HP Honda, and it does a very good job.
