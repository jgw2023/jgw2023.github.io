                            The distance from one side of the circle to the other, going through the center of the circle, is the diameter. The constant pi, designated by the Greek letter π, is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle. For any circle, if you divide the circumference by the diameter you get pi, an irregular number usually rounded to 3.14.
