                            Well, yes and no. From the ninth century AD (though the historians are still uncertain about the exact date of its invention) to the mid-1800s, black powder was the only explosive available. A single type of explosives was therefore used as a propellant for guns and for blasting purpose in any military, mining and civil engineering application.

                            One of the great advantages of ANFO is that it is convenient and inherently safe to use. ANFO can supplied pre-mixed in 10-25 kg bags, which are simply poured into blastholes (Figures 3.2 & 3.3). In large surface operations, quantities of correctly proportioned and mixed ANFO are charged quickly and efficiently by bulk ANFO mix trucks.
