                            Unlike traditional drilling, a milling cutter can move along multiple axes. It also has the capability to create a wide array of shapes, slots, holes, and other necessary impressions. Plus, the work piece of a CNC mill can be moved across the milling tool in specific directions.

                            Texxik, Thanks for the response. Yes, during the simulation the lines are visible but after milling there are more lines than the simulation. I don't know if the simulation draws info from the post processor? I think that it would work better to have it use R(radius) instead of I,J&K for a circle and it would cut back on the number of blocks.
