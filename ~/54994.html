                            Open Pit Mining. Open Pit mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by removal from an open pit. It is used when diamond ore appears near the surface of is covered by a relatively thin layer of sand or gravel. Once the ore has been exposed, it is broken up before taking it to be processed.

                            Open pit mines can be used in coal mining, and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores, copper, gold, iron, aluminum, and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine, the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation, since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

A managed transition took place during which underground mining rates "ramped up" while open pit mining approached planned completion. In late 2012, open pit mining ended and the Diavik Diamond Mine became a fully underground mine.
