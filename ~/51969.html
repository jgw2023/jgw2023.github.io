                            The gyratory crusher can, just like a jaw crusher, accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). – This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. – As is the case for jaw crushers, there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces, but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.

I think by increasing RPM you'll get a finer product w/ no appreciable increase in production as all you've accomplished is decrease the amount of time the jaw is at max opening. The only good answer to this is a bigger jaw.

                            Jaw Crushers are sized by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher measures 32" from jaw die to jaw die at the top opening or gape opening and 54" across the width of the two jaw dies. The narrower bottom opening of the crushing chamber is used to size the discharge material.
