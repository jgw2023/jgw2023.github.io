                            Gold dominates the mining sector and the country is Africa's second largest gold producer after South Africa. Surface Mining, which refers to a method of extracting minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrows, requires a large tract of land for its operations (Wikipedia, 2008).

                            The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today.
