                            Flipscreen – The worlds best screening attachment!
                            FlipScreen has the largest screening surface area of its class. Which explains the high volume screening rates. For example, a WL180 wheel loader screening bucket has a screen surface area of 73.2 square feet (6.8 square meters). Every 2.5 seconds, the material travels the whole area of the mesh.

                            The screening a Static Grizzly separator does is sort and classify the rock according to size. The first stage is SCALPING. This is the practice of removing any material that may slow production. It may be rock that is too big for the equipment to effectively handle, or fine material that is taking up valuable space and will consume precious energy if there is further handling.
