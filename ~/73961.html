                            M-22 "Rock Crusher" Identification. The M-22 close-ratio transmission is easily identified internally from the M-20 and M-21 versions by the angle of the gear teeth. The M-22 was only produced in a close-ratio version, so it will not appear on models with high rear-axle ratios (3.55 or lower numerically) unless someone has changed it.
