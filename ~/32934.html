                            Lowry, original, coming from the mill
                            A naive Sunday artist LS Lowry actually was not. Lowry strove for a particular method of painting and drawing, and for a topic Lowry might make unique. Lowry ultimately selected the view from the Technical College window. Industrial scenes of Salford and Manchester, as opposed to that of a mannequin posing.

                            I first saw some Lowry originals and original prints on a Cunard "Queen Victoria" cruise in April. Then I saw the film on recent release. Then I ordered "Coming home from the Mill", from you, and hung it in the bathroom- thinking that it would be lovely to study it in detail while shaving and laying in the bath (and saving many thousands of ££ on the original prints).

                            In a letter to Salford Museum & Art Gallery Lowry wrote, 'It gives me great pleasure that Salford have bought this picture for I have always thought it was my most characteristic mill scene.' The painting is based on an earlier pastel drawing Lowry made in about 1917 which was one of his first composite industrial scenes.

                            Jul 26, 2011 · In Coming From the Mill we see people on their way home from work in the shadow of an imposing, industrial skyline. Lowry's 'matchstick men' have been described as 'naive', the works of a 'Sunday painter' but there can be few of these which now fetch up to £5.6m at auction.
