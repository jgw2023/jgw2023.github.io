                            Lats but not least, you can only attempt higher alchemy stone upgrades with higher Alchemy Tier (for example, Skilled, Professional, Artisan etc. will unlock a higher grade of alchemy stone you can attempt). Regarding black stones, no choice there, you can only use a single black stone each time, although the UI might be a bit confusing on that.
