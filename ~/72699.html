                            There is no doubt that the Beats and Sony are more comfortable than the Skullcandy Crusher wireless. Even the Hesh 2's are more comfortable than the Crushers. That said, none of them in my opinion match the Skullcandy Crusher wireless when it comes to sound quality (highs, mids and lows).
