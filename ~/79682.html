                            Granite is the most widespread of igneous rocks, underlying much of the continental crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive rocks form from molten material (magma) that flows and solidifies underground, where magma cools slowly. Eventually, the overlying rocks are removed, exposing the granite.

                            Although the two rock types have the same chemistry, rhyolite is extrusive and granite is intrusive. While granite has crystals that are generally easy to see, in rhyolite the crystals are often too small to see. This is due to the more rapid cooling of the rhyolite lava compared to granite's slower cooling magma.
