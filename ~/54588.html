                            Ore Dilution & Recovery in Mining
                            Recovery and dilution usually are interrelated; with some methods of stoping a high recovery involves contamination of the ore from the walls or capping, and often clean ore can be obtained only by leaving some ore in the mine. In open-stope mines the greatest loss of ore is that tied up in pillars left for support of the back or hanging wall.

                            Cut-and-fill stoping is applicable to the mining of firm ore enclosed within walls, one or both of which are weak and heavy. The deposits may be tabular in form, dipping at angles steeper than the angle of repose of the broken ore (or flatter, if scrapers are employed for moving the ore in the ore passes), or to wide, thick ore bodies or masses.

                            Shrinkage stoping is a mining method used for steeply dipping, narrower ore bodies with self supporting walls and ore. It is an overhand mining method that relies on broken ore being left in the stope to be used as the "working floor" and to support the walls. During the mining cycle, only 30 – 35% of the ore blasted is extracted being .
