                            Jun 15, 2015 · Where should an air separator be located? The best place to locate an air separator in a hydronic system is where the water temperature is high and the pressure is low. The solubility of the dissolved gases in the water is lowest at these conditions. For a heating system, the ideal location is at the outlet of the heat source.
