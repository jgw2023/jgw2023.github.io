                            The main color giving component of natural red ochre (ocher) is composed of hematite (∝-Fe 2 O 3). The term red ochre (ocher) or red earth describes various kinds of iron oxide pigments such as Venetian red, mars red, English red, Indian red. The nomenclature is by no means unequivocal and various authors have used the names differently.

                            Iron ochre results from a chemical reaction or a biological process, and both of these causes may occur either individually or simultaneously: Chemical reaction: When the soil contains iron, it migrates along with the water towards the drainage system. When it comes in contact with the atmosphere, it forms a sludge of iron hydroxide.
