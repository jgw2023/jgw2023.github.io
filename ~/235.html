                            Los Angeles Abrasion Test on Aggregates -Values for Pavements
                            Los Angeles abrasion test on aggregates is the measure of aggregate toughness and abrasion resistance such as crushing, degradation and disintegration. This test is carried out by AASHTO T 96 or ASTM C 131: Resistance to Degradation of Small-Size Coarse Aggregate by Abrasion and Impact in the Los Angeles Machine.

                            Jan 23, 2018 · Aggregate having AIV % equal or greater than 35 % is considered bad to use in road construction. PURPOSE OF TEST: Aggregate Impact Value test determines the Aggregate Impact Value (AIV) of aggregates which provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to sudden shock or impact.

                            If the aggregates are weak, the stability of the pavement structure is likely to be adversely affected. The strength of coarse aggregates is assessed by aggregates crushing test. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.
