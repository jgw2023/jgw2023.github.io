                            Another benefit of the CNC router is that they broadly tend to offer more working space in the X- and Y- axes, with a shallow Z-axis movement when compared to the CNC mill. Despite being generally less stiff than a CNC mill, the stiffness and quality of a CNC router depends on the price tag.
