                            Failure mode effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) is an extension of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). FMEA is a bottom-up, inductive analytical method which may be performed at either the functional or piece-part level. FMECA extends FMEA by including a criticality analysis, which is used to chart the probability of failure modes against the severity of their consequences.
