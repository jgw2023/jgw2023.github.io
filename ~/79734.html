                            The figure to the left shows the typical application ranges for ball mills and stirred mill. The Vertimill is always more efficient than a ball mill with energy savings ranging from 30% to greater than 50%. The transition point from the Vertimill to an SMD varies depending on the ore properties but generally is in the range of 20 to 40 microns.

                            Note that the hardness of these scats is not measured by a Bond BWi because that test crushes everything to minus 3.35 mm, the maximum size for good ball milling or VERTIMILL efficiency. I do agree that the VERTIMILL power will be lower than a ball mill so there is merit in replacing ball mills with Vertical Stirred mills.

                            Figure 10.1 shows the difference in energy efficiency between a laboratory ball mill and a stirred mill grinding a gold ore using 6 mm diameter alumina balls as media. At a fine grind size there is a clear advantage in energy consumption for a stirred mill over the tumbling mill. However, as the grind size coarsens, the difference in specific energy required to achieve the grind lessens.
