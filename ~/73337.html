                            Worcester Controls Three Piece Ball Valves
                            The downstream sealing of Worcester Controls' three-piece valves overcomes the two most common difficulties in the use of conventional ball valves: seat damage and high oper-ating torque. A hole in the stem slot prevents any possibility of damage due to trapped cavity pressure when the ball is open.
