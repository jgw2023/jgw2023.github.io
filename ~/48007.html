                            Mar 17, 2016 · This is an excellent press for the money. I've owned about every single stage press made and the rc supreme is definitely top of the line. The primer catcher works just fine as long as it's properly positioned of course it's not one hundred percent reliable, but the quality of the overall press excuses that fault.

                            The Rock Crusher plays the same track as Ironheade's Megastage to create its attack buff. Driving the Rock Crusher along terrain ledges or otherwise placing it on an uneven footing may cause it to spontaneously flip and explode. In the event of the Rock Crusher's destruction, there is a wait period before the player can summon another one.
