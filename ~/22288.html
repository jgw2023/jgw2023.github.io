The flowsheet route for copper is fairly well established while the processing options for cobalt vary considerably depending on the final product (metal or salt) the operator wishes to make. The mineralogy of ores in the area is typically associated with high gangue acid consumption during the leaching process. This has

                            Many modern gold plants incorporate gravity circuits as part of their overall flowsheet, and it is estimated that about 10% of the new gold produced each year is recovered by this technique. The advantages and disadvantages of gravity separation are similar to heap leaching. It is a very simple and low cost process, but gold recovery is usually low
