                            Rolling processes 
                            Rolling is the process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross section of a long workpiece by compressive forces applied through a set of rolls, as shown in figure (5-1). Fig. (5-1) Most rolling is carried out by hot working, called hot rolling, owing to the large amount of deformation required. Hot-rolled metal is generally free of .

                            Hot rolling breaks the grain structures and destroys the boundaries, giving rise to the formation of new structures with strong boundaries having uniform grain structures. Starting materials such as blooms or slabs at an elevated temperature flow from the continuous casting process directly into the rolling mills.
