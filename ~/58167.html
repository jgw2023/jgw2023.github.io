                            In Grinding, selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum/ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do. Often, the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case". Well, this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and/or mill liner wear and tear.
