                            M-22 "Rock Crusher" Identification. The M-22 close-ratio transmission is easily identified internally from the M-20 and M-21 versions by the angle of the gear teeth. The M-22 was only produced in a close-ratio version, so it will not appear on models with high rear-axle ratios (3.55 or lower numerically) unless someone has changed it.

                            Oct 01, 2008 · M22 had straighter cut gears. Sounds kind of like a gear drive timing set. Unmistakable sound. I don't know how many people I've had tell me "Oh ya this thing has a Rock Crusher (colloquial term for M22) in it. I've only heard the sound of the real deal once.

                            The M22 was eventually dubbed the "Rock Crusher". It is a common misconception that all Muncie transmissions are "Rock Crushers", but it is only the M22 that deserves that name. The M20 and M21 were both release in 1963, but it wasn't until 1965 that the M22 hit the market. The M22 was created for the Corvette Grand Sport racing program.
