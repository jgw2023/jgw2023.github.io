                            on back-up rolls 3-5 hours, is still very common. As a result of increasing cost pressure, the demands for short-ened grinding times rise due to increasing automation. Grinding times of 25 to 35 minutes for work rolls and 90 to 120 minutes for back-up rolls can be realized with modern machinery and ATLANTIC grinding tools which are adapted to that.

                            Back-up rolls, although they have to support the pressure exerted on the work rolls, are not in direct contact with the steel. Due to the extreme stresses on rolls in a steel mill, the demands on regrinding them are extraordinarily high with regard to accuracy and uptime.
