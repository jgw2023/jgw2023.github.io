                            A hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works was a workshop in the pre-industrial era that was typically used to manufacture semi-finished, wrought iron products or, sometimes, finished agricultural or mining tools, or military weapons. The feature that gave its name to these workshops was the water-driven trip hammer, or set of hammers, used in the process.

                            Roller mills are the most common mill used in the U.S. Corn Belt. They are more energy efficient and generally result in a more uniform particle size than hammer mills. However, hammer mills are still in use, and preferred when the feed will be pelleted or a need for greater flexibility in particle size.
