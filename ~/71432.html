                            Why is the coffee grinder making a strange noise? Most of the noise produced by the machine comes from the mill. A bit of noise is therefore normal when the coffee is grinding. Sometimes a foreign body finds its way into the grinder. In this case, empty the coffee bean container and vacuum out the interior near the grinder.
