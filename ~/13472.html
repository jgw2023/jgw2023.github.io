                            Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes
                            Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed, the overall removal is quite brisk.
