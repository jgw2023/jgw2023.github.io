                            Dec 21, 2012 · Came home with a couple John Deere #52 plows, so thought I'd share some pics. The one with paint is ready to use, while the rusty one needs some TLC and a few parts to make operational. Note that the painted one has IHC coulter assemblies, while the other has the original Deere ones.

                            Moldboard plowing was historically a farming practice that was slow and tiresome. Other manufacturers had already offered newer style plow bottoms which were less expensive to repair/replace the wear parts and by the early 1950's John Deere was playing catch-up.
