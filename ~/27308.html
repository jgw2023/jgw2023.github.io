                            Simplified Wire Inlay on Wood: 11 Steps (with Pictures)
                            From what I saw, it was a time-intenstive process that involved lots of superglue, plus intense wire-flattening (and special cubic cross-section wire too..). Being short on time at the moment but still interested in wire inlay, I wondered if there were any way to shorten the amount of processing time while maintaining that wire-in-wood look.

                            Inlay cladding has several advantages over selective plating.

Through careful selection of materials, a surface can be attained that is denser, harder and more wear .
