                            These minerals together with relicts of partially dissolved quartz form the bulk of laterites. The transformation of rock into laterite proceeds in general gradually as indicated by the steady increase of iron and decrease of silica in laterite profiles above the parent rock.

                            Eighty-four million tons, or 60 percent of the total available nickel is in laterite deposits. A deposit in which rain and surface water leached nickel-rich rock and concentrated the nickel at or near the surface of the Earth is a laterite deposit. Nickel sulfide deposits contain the remaining forty percent (56 million tons).

Practically all meteorites contain a significant amount of extraterrestrial iron and nickel, so the first step in identifying a possible meteorite is the magnet test.

                            Jun 12, 2014 · As the original nickel bearing rock weathers into a soil, the nickel finds its way into multiple minerals throughout the weathered profile. The source of the nickel is typically from the mineral olivine (Iron-magnesium silicate), a predominant mineral in peridotites (a common type of ultramafic rock).

However I have found several rocks (suspect meteorites) that test positive for nickel. I dont think the rocks ive found are meteorites for other reasons, but Im trying to identify what the rocks are so I can eliminate them in the future.

                            Native Iron is quite often a misnomer as natural iron is not necessarily "native" to Earth since it rarely occurs on the Earth's surface by terrestrial processes. It is mostly found in the form of meteorites that have impacted the Earth's surface. A few rare terrestrial gabbros and sulfide deposits do contain elemental iron-nickel deposits, these are the only truly native iron-nickel.

Depending on the dynamics of the magma chamber the sulphides can be thought to have sunk between and cemented together earlier formed silicate minerals or the silicates may have settled into a sulphide pool as the chamber cooled.

                            Use of nickel (as a natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden.
