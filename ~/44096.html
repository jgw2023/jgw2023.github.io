                            Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, followed by China. In 2017, China was the top producer of aluminium with almost half of the world's production, followed by Russia, Canada, and India. Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.

                            The Greymeck process once operated in Poland is essentially a wet cement process that also produces alumina; it produces around 9 tonnes of cement for every tonne of alumina. Based around sinter technology, one plant in China (Mengxi) has been built around this technology. The aluminous feed stock for the process is high alumina fly ash.
