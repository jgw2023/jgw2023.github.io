                            In 2015, 27.6 million metric tons of marketable phosphate rock, or phosphorite, was mined in the United States, making the US the world's third-largest producer, after China and Morocco.The phosphate mining industry employed 2,200 people. The value of phosphate rock mined was US 2.2 billion.. As of 2015, there are 10 active phosphate mines in four states: Florida, North Carolina, Idaho, and Utah.

                            Phosphate deposits can contain significant amounts of naturally occurring heavy metals. Mining operations processing phosphate rock can leave tailings piles containing elevated levels of cadmium, lead, nickel, copper, chromium, and uranium. Unless carefully managed, these waste products can leach heavy metals into groundwater or nearby estuaries.
