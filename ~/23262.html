                            AC Replacement for DC Mill-Duty Motors For many years, DC mill auxiliary motors for steel mill applications were specified as Type MD. Many of these motors have been replaced with less-rugged DC or AC motors. This paper reviews the features of direct-replacement AC mill auxiliary motors.
