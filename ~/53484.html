                            Hammer mills work on the principle that most materials will crush, shatter, or pulverize upon impact. Material is fed into the mill's chamber through the feed chute, typically by gravity, where it is struck by ganged hammers attached to a shaft that rotates at high speed inside the mill's grinding chamber.
