                            Since these bodies lack molten cores and are too small to have atmospheres, it is probable that they are still more or less as they were when they were formed. Periodically, some of them are pulled out of orbit by comets and crash into the Sun. On rare occasions, the earth gets in the way, and these rock bodies strike our planet.

At other times, the minerals in the groundwater actually replace the minerals that make up the remains. So over time the hard parts are completely replaced by other minerals. This process is called replacement.
