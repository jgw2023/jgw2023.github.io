                            Pneumatic die grinder as cut-off tool?
                            Jan 10, 2013 · It sounds like you haven't found an air die grinder like my CP860 then. It has plenty of power to run a 3" cut off disc. 4" grinders are cheap but I have a 7/9" grinder here that'll beat a number of 4s at the same time. Working with that beast will put hair on your chest though. I have a pile of beat 4.5 and 4" angle grinders over here.

                            Aug 20, 2007 · Rotozips are just small routers and are too big to properly get into the tight spaces one associates with 2 inch angle die grinders. Also the Rotozip body/handle is too awkward to hold at right angle with any precision. If one was going to use a Rotozip they might as well use a 4 inch angle grinder.

                            Die Grinder or Dremel A die grinder is kind of like a high-speed, high-powered drill. However, most die grinders don't use a handle perpendicular to the bit as drills do. Your grinder can be air- or electric-powered; it all depends on what you favor and what you have to work with.
