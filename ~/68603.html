                            Owning your own grain or malt mill offers a number of benefits. First of all, you can optimize the grain crush to maximize the efficiency of your specific brewing system. Secondly, uncrushed grain has a longer shelf life, allowing you to buy grain in bulk and keep all of your favorite brewing malts on hand for those unplanned brew days.

I have also noticed that beers with the corona mill also tend to attenuate about 2-3 points further than with the dual roller LHBS crush.
