                            A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

                            Aug 27, 2010 · The crusher is very heavy duty and will crush any rock or masonry easily Haven't done as much work with it as I'd like as my other business interests have been too busy. But I hope to give it a good shake this winter. I have a portable 240v conveyor to work with the crusher on bigger jobs.
