                            The Crusher is built out of 12 special blocks made from a Block of Steel, Pistons, and Diamonds. If broken down, it takes 3 Blocks of Steel, 12 Pistons, and 12 Diamonds to build one Rock Crusher. Rock Crushers cannot be built adjacent to each other—there must be at least one tile in between Rock Crushers.

                            Crusher - Wikipedia
                            A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

                            You might be drawn to a mini machine for cost and portability reasons, but if the machine can't accommodate the sizes of rock you need it to, it won't be efficient or effective for your business. Thus, one of the first things you'll need to check before buying is the maximum size of the rock sheet you can feed into the jaw crusher.

                            A rock crusher is a device used to crush rocks into smaller pieces, usually for gravel or some other road or building application. Most rock crushers have a hopper at the top -- a container which holds the rock above the crusher and uses gravity to feed it in. Alternately, rock crushers can use a belt drive to continuously transport the rock into the crusher.
