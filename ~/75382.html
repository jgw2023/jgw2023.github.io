                            Gold ore is a fairly rare ore found in Minecraft. When mined with an iron pickaxe or better, it drops one gold ore. It serves little use in crafting tools because the resulting tools won't be very durable, a fact often overlooked by players. Gold ore is found deeper than many ores in the game.
