                            Five Reasons to Convert Cone 10 Reduction Glazes to Cone 6 .
                            Oct 02, 2019 · I feel I should point out that the idea here is not to reformulate cone 10 glazes to cone 6, but to use glazes specifically designed for cone 6. The fluxes that are active at cone 6 are different from those for cone 10, so it's often a shorter path to start from scratch.

                            Although we offer Cone 6 Porcelain as a cone 6 clay body, artists enjoy the flashing results from firing it in a cone 10 wood-kiln. When fired in oxidation to cone 6 it has a shrinkage of 11% and absorption of 1%. Consider Cone 6 Porcelain if you like Lindsey's Porcelain, A-Clay White Stoneware or Kenzan Porcelain.

It only takes a few minutes to scrape out the pug mill and then I can switch back and forth (about every month) between the regular cone 6 production and cone 10 clays. There are not many commercial clays that do what I want for wood firing, and they can get fairly expensive.
