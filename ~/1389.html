                            A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g., via a hand crank), working animal (e.g., horse mill), wind or water ().

                            Power requirements are reduced because nonsynchronous roll speeds shred or grind the grain instead of compressing it. The heavy duty chain drive, self-aligning bearings (sealed for life), and large-diameter fatigue-proof shafts--all critical components--contribute to the durability and quality of the DeMuth Roller Mills.

This latter process has the distinct advantage of requiring considerably less power, although it is not possible to achieve the fineness of final grind through a roller mill that can be achieved through a hammermill.
