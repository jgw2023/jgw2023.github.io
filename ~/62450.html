                            Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is an oxide of silicon with the chemical formula Si O 2, most commonly found in nature as quartz and in various living organisms. In many parts of the world, silica is the major constituent of sand.Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing as a compound of several minerals and as synthetic product.

                            Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations, but dredging and underground mining are also employed. Extracted ore undergoes considerable processing to increase the silica content by reducing impurities. It is then dried and sized to produce the optimum particle size distribution for the intended application.
