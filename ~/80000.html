                            OLH hot air systems are useful for aggregate heating. Winter construction must be supplied with the warm concrete, also the concrete plant must be working safely during the winter. Very high demand of the concrete with up to 20°C can only be achieved by aggregate heating. For these requirements, our hot air system OLH is the ideal solution.

                            A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
