                            Dec 26, 2016 · I am new to Fusion 360 and i also have a Bridgeport mill (V2XT) which also uses Boss9 (Boss 9i in my case). I would also like to know the answer to this question. I know from past experience that nothing Generic worked. I started with EZ-Cam which was a subsidiary of Bridgeport .
