                            5 Best Milling Machines - Jan. 2020 - BestReviews
                            A milling machine is a complex, high-precision tool. You should expect to make a considerable investment. Cheap mills do exist, but we have serious doubts about their durability and ability to produce accurate results. A good micro mill that would satisfy the demands of miniaturists and model makers will cost between  400 and  500.

The Grizz mill works fine and if I ever moved to a larger machine, I could always use it as a second operation tool. As for the Sherline, it is a very nice tool but it is less than 1/3 the weight and over twice the price.

                            Best small mill/lathe for a hobby shop. I'd like to put a small shop in my basement to do some hobby work and build tools or gadgets to use around the house. I'm thinking mostly aluminum stuff, but maybe drilling up to 1/2" steel and there might be a need for 3/4" holes in the steel.
