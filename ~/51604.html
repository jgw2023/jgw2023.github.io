                            What Is Involved in Manganese Mining?
                            Nov 26, 2019 · Manganese mining often requires a specific method of extraction, because nodules can be embedded among various other rock bed materials. One of the benefits to open-pit mining is reduced cost compared to other mining methods. The change in geologic configuration, however, means the environmental impact of this mining is often considered severe.

                            The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar, narrow vein stoping and large-scale mechanised mining. Room and pillar mining is a style of mining where tunnels are driven in a chess board pattern with massive square pillars between them which are gradually cut away as the work proceeds. We use this for mining coal.
