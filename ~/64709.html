                            HPGR or high-pressure grinding rolls have made broad advances into nonferrous metal mining. The technology is now widely viewed as a primary milling alternative, and there arc a number of large installations commissioned in recent years. After these developments, an HPGR based circuit configuration would often be the base case for certain ore types, such as very hard, abrasive ores.
