                            Oct 08, 2011 · The diameter of a slitting saw is much larger than that of a mill cutter and it has many teeth. This means the speed of the cutting surface will be fairly high even at low RPM compared to an end mill. For example, the Surface Feet per Minute cutting speed (SFM) for high speed steel is .
