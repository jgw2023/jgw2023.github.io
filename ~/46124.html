                            One inherent weakness in current UIS drilling practices is their inability to maintain the bit within the confines of the coal seam. As a result, coal seam boreholes tend to undulate, frequently drilling out of the seam. This requires pullbacks and branching, which duplicates drilling metres – and establishing a branch takes time.
