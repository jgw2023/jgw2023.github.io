                            In recent years, the trend in open pit mining has been to minimize truck haulage and substitute belt conveyor systems. Initially the crusher was placed at the pit perimeter, with the natural evolution to ''in-pit'' crushing, and finally, the relative recent development of portable in-pit crushers.
