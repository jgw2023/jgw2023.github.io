                            This paper presents an algebraic approach for identifying bottlenecks in continuous process systems where each process unit is characterized by fixed mass and energy balance relationships. In industrial applications, such a system is designed to produce a particular product portfolio. This is determined from the anticipated products market and is taken as a baseline state.
