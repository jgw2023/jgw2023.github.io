                            Michigan Sugar's Caro plant sends an average of 60,000 tons of lime to sugar-beet farmers each year. The beet noodles, now free of most of their sugar, are dried into beet pulp for livestock feed. The raw juice is treated with lime (CaCO3) and carbon dioxide gas to clean the mixture again.

                            Lime is used to capture and remove impurities in the juice of sugar beets. 125kg of limestone are used for the production of one ton of sugar. Most sugar-processing plants have their own lime kilns, so they need good-quality limestone to burn. The high calcium limestone is converted into quicklime in these lime kilns, at a temperature of 900°C.

                            Spreading lime from the processing of sugar beets on agricultural soil is a way to re-use a discarded material that would otherwise be wasted. Finding previously-used sources of lime is a way to reduce our environmental footprint while maintaining the soil conditions necessary for optimal agricultural production.

                            The main differences between hydrated lime and quicklime are their reactivity & their chemical composition. Hydrated lime and quicklime are both calcium compounds. In its hydrated state, calcium is called calcium hydroxide, and in its pure state it is called calcium oxide, or quicklime.. Calcium oxide has a heavy density (65lb/ft³) and is more reactive than hydrated lime.
