                            Commentaire de darneigh Mining Filon de trillium and Riche filon de trillium provide either Minerai de trillium noir or Minerai de trillium blanc, they are a rare spawn, normally spawn in ghost iron node locations in the same zone.Looking closely at the node you can see a black and white swirl symbol on it. If you can see the color of the rock under the vein, the ore mined will be the same color.
