                            Solution mining is a more energy intensive process than conventional mining. Comparing 11 potash mines in Saskatchewan, solution mining's average energy consumption was about 1300kWh/tonne and conventional mining's was close to 400kWh/tonne. Natural gas represents the largest source of energy type for the Canadian potash industry .

                            Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content, and, since the 1880s, has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production.

                            Longwall mining has traditionally been a manual process in which alignment of the face equipment was done with string lines. Technologies have been developed which automates several aspects of the longwall mining operation, including a system that aligns the face of the retreating longwall panel perpendicularly to the gate-roads.

                            Coal seam gas (CSG) mining is a risky, invasive form of unconventional gas mining. Coal seam gas extraction usually involves tens of thousands of gas wells, with roads, pipelines, compressor stations, wastewater dams, and other infrastructure. A CSG project can spread across hundreds of thousands of hectares of land.
