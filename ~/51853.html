                            So you've decided to slam four with a GM Muncie Transmission
                            Among "old-timers", the Muncie transmission commands a certain degree of respect. Sure, you could get a manual in tons of cars from GM during the 60's and 70's, but the Muncie was the one to have. Saginaw transmissions were cheaper, and worked admirably, but scattering gear oil on the pavement was a scary reality if you pushed them too hard.

                            Feb 21, 2010 · The most well known Muncie transmissions are the M20(wide ratio), M21(close ratio), and the M22(rock crusher).

                            Oct 19, 2009 · I started out with Pontiacs in the late '70s, and moved into Mopars because of chronic 4-speed transmission problems. I make no excuses about being a big A833 fan, and in my opinion the 18-spline hemi 4-speed is the strongest of the three. The Toploader would be a reasonbly close second, and the Muncie would be the last.

                            The M22 was eventually dubbed the "Rock Crusher". It is a common misconception that all Muncie transmissions are "Rock Crushers", but it is only the M22 that deserves that name. The M20 and M21 were both release in 1963, but it wasn't until 1965 that the M22 hit the market. The M22 was created for the Corvette Grand Sport racing program.
