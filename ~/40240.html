                            The Quarry Story - Vulcan Materials Company
                            The area that begins to form out of the earth when we blast away big pieces of rock becomes the quarry or pit. We use very large haul trucks to load and move the rocks out of the pit and to the processing plant where they are crushed and divided into different sizes. Trucks move back and forth between the pit and the processing plant.
