                            I'm currently leveling my 3rd Blacksmith and haven't bought anything from the AH. I think that using the stones is the best way to level BS while it still retains a color. They're practically free levels while you your mining your ore and as a miner, you save tons of ore. Its a win win situation.

                            I looked up the guides on wow-profesions and it showed how you can level 1-700 BS with Draenor ore but on the mining guide it says to progress through all of the low level areas(1-50 copper, 50-100 tin & so on). Would it not be quicker to just mine the fragments in Draenor areas? I would love some advice on quickly and efficiently leveling.
