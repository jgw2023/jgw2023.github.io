                            Quartz sandstone results from the extreme weathering and sorting of a sediment until everything that can be removed has been removed. Complete chemical weathering is required to remove all feldspars and lithics, but the final removal of the clay takes place in high energy environments, typically beach environments, although other high energy situations such as tidal sand bars can accumulate .
