                            Ballast less than 300 mm (12 inches) thick can lead to vibrations that damage nearby structures. However, increasing the depth beyond 300 mm (12 inches) confers no extra benefit in reducing vibration. In turn, track ballast typically rests on a layer of small crushed stones: the sub-ballast.
