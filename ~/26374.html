                            Mining ceased, the site was remediated and closed in 2014, leaving a common perception that the deposit had been exhausted. Arctic-Resources (now AEX Gold Inc.) challenged this view and acquired the mining licence in 2015. SRK's task was to make the case for Nalunaq's exploration potential and test these ideas in the field.

                            The success of exploration and mining projects depends on the comprehensive understanding of each deposit's 3D geometry. This knowledge can be gained by building 3D models to evaluate exploration risk, mine stability, and grade distribution and to provide a basis for robus t resource estimation and conceptual mining studies.
