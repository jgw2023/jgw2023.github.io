                            Graphite powder size is generally less than 500 meshes,it's generally 100 meshes, 120 meshes, 200 meshes, 325meshes and other specifications. Especially delanium graphite,it's artificially made of coke, asphalt and other raw material processed by calcining, crushing, screening, forming and graphitizing. So the propertty of the graphite powder is relatively stable.
