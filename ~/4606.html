                            Quincy Granite has always been noted for its high polish, due to the fact that every surface of the entire substance will take a high gloss, there being no mica in Quincy Granite. Shortly after 1900 the surfacing machine came into general use, re- placing hand labor in roughing off surfaces of granite.

                            Granite is among the oldest rock on earth. Hidden deep beneath the grounds surface, granite reveals itself only after the softer, upper layers of dirt and rock have worn away, allowing its strength and power to be unveiled. Granite is a rock of the ages - a rock that has withstood the test of time.
