                            Small grain hammermills can be operated on current. Large hammer mills used in automobile shredders may be driven by diesel or electric motors ranging from 2000 to over 5000 horsepower (1.5 - 3.7MW). The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones. It is designed to be more reliable, and is also .

                            Hammer mills work on the principle that most materials will crush, shatter, or pulverize upon impact. Material is fed into the mill's chamber through the feed chute, typically by gravity, where it is struck by ganged hammers attached to a shaft that rotates at high speed inside the mill's grinding chamber.
