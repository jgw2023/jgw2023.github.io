                            Red mud, or bauxite residue, is a side-product of the Bayer process, the principal means of refining bauxite en route to alumina. The resulting alumina is the raw material for producing aluminium by the Hall–Héroult process. A typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina.

                            May 08, 2014 · Hand-arm vibration syndrome seems to be rare in bauxite mining and alumina refining. Vibrating hand tools are not an important part of the process at bauxite mines, but are common at alumina refineries. Nevertheless, most bauxite mines and alumina refineries are located in tropical climates, so cold-provoked vasospasm is less likely.
