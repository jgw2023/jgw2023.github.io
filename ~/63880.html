                            Well, it's a grain mill, so it mills grain. I get about 68% efficiency with this mill. It takes about two minutes to get through about 10 pounds of grain. To use the mill, you'll need to hook a drill to the end of the bolts with a driver socket. Turn on the drill to start spinning the rollers (PVC pipe) and then add your grain.

                            Jun 30, 2019 · I think the two biggest differences between mills is longevity and sturdiness of the mill and how many rollers you prefer. I use a cereal killer mill cause it was a nice price of entry for starting to mill at home and buy bulk. It has worked for me great so far but can not responsibly say that it is a great mill as it has not been time tested.

                            Homemade Grain Mill Commercially made roller type mills use stainless steal knurled rollers. Since these rollers have a knurled surface, they can use a smaller diameter roller while pulling grain through the mill with the rough roller surface. Since I would have to depend on a machine shop for knurling, I wanted to avoid knurling if possible.
