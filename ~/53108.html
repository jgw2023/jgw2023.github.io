                            Hydraulic Drifters. Montabert drifters are the result of years of experience in hydraulic rock breakers and drifters design and manufacturing. In-depth knowledge of shock wave transmission and percussion mechanism theory has allowed our engineers to be the first to develop new concepts such as hydraulic dampening and progressive blow energy.

                            Continued fraction - Wikipedia
                            In a finite continued fraction (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an infinite continued fraction is an infinite expression. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive.
