I have heard there are places you can go find your own stones and afterwards pay by weight or if there are better options and alternatives I would love to hear them.

                            "Rock Crystal" is the name for clear, colorless quartz. In a sense, rock crystal is the ideal image of quartz. The term crystal goes back to the Greeks, who once thought that since the crystals came from high in the mountains, they might be ice frozen so deeply that it is can't melt again (another interpretation says they meant crystals to be some substance frozen very deeply, but not .

The best quality, largest, and most abundant crystals come from ancient stream channels in the Mokelumne Hill area of Calveras County.

                            Apr 25, 2017¬†¬∑ The reason for this is that although quartz is known for its hardness, it damages easily if it is suddenly exposed to a change in temperature, such as that caused by a blast. Instead, mining operations use bulldozers and backhoes to remove soil and clay, and expose the quartz crystal veins in the rock.
