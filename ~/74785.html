                            Elemental gold has a specific gravity of 19.3, and typical ore has a specific gravity of about 2.6. All gravity concentration devices create movement between the gold and host rock particles in a manner to separate the heavy pieces from the lighter pieces of material. The prospector's gold pan is the most familiar gravity concentration device.
