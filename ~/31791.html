                            Nov 26, 2009 · I had a late-model Millrite for 2 years, and I loved it. The only downside is that they have a someone plain head, with no downfeed stop, no powerfeed, and you could either get a drill-press style rack and pinion rapid downfeed, or a fine feed, but not both. And the way the quill was designed, it's very tough to add whichever one you didn't get.

Long story short, dad let it go back to the guy who bought it for us back then. Invoice price in 1969 was  1,888.88.
