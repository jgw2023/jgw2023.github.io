                            Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
                            The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

                            The ball mill's low pressure oil system pumps oil from the reservoir through a filter assembly to clean the oil before the flow is sent to the trunnion bearings. During start-up, the oil is also pumped to the high pressure pump. Dual cartridge filters, connected in parallel, continually clean the oil.

                            A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g., via a hand crank), working animal (e.g., horse mill), wind or water ().
