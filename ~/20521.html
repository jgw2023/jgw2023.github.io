                            Portland Cement . Cement: is a material with adhesive and cohesive properties which make it capable of bonding minerals fragments into a compact whole. For constructional purposes, the meaning of the term "cement" is restricted to the bonding materials used with stones, sand, bricks, building stones, etc.

                            The Pozzolona Cement (PPC) is a kind of cement, produced when fly ash is blended with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), to a maximum percentage of 35. The process of blending is done in a ball mill with Ordinary Portland Cement, gypsum and fly ash, in order to produce homogenous quality of cement.

                            In case study 2, following the change of the bearings of the grinding rolls, the plant team was looking for a way to reduce the risk of bearing failure. During mill operation roller surfaces wear down, which results in a higher dynamic load, peaks which exceed the nominal torque and, in general, an instable mill operation and lower performance.
