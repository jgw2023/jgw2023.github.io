While the shaker will separate better at higher G forces, shaker screens are subjected to higher amounts of abrasion from solids and mechanical force. G-Forces in excess of 7 and above have been shown to be detrimental to screen life and the shaker itself. Most shale shakers run between 3.5 G's and 6.5 G's.
