                            Ball Mills - The Ceramic Shop
                            Ball mills can be used to further break down or refine a single material, or you can place multiple materials into a ball mill jar to mix as you pulverize -- this is a very common industrial solution for mixing glazes that require the smallest of mesh sizes. Ball mills basically function like a mortar and pestle, but on a much larger scale.

                            Planetary ball mill is a versatile machine which has been used for grinding different types of materials for size reduction and lately for hemp decortication. PFC3D, software employing the discrete element method (DEM), was used to simulate the power and energy requirement of grinding hemp for fibre using a planetary ball mill.

                            Subject: Re: more ball mill questions. Hello All, Vince is right, a ceramic jar is the way to go. It grinds between the pebbles and the jar. As potters, you should be able to make your own jars, don't you think? Just make it nice and thick, and cylindrical and vitreous. You can do it. You can make your own pebbles too. Best, Paul Herman
