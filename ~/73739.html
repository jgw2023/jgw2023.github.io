                            Tramming the Homier 03988 Mill . Last Modified: A rite of passage for mill owners is the tramming process, where the head is adjusted to be (almost) perfectly perpendicular to the table. The Homier mill is no exception; my mill's head was slightly off, typical for all mills.

When the mill arrived to my shop it was mostly assembled but I decides to take it apart, clean, lubricate and adjust the way I wanted.

For hobby work, however, a so-called "mini mill" can perform very well. The chief limitation of a mini-mill is not so much the quality of the work it can produce, but the size of the work it can handle.

                            The Mini-Mill Head Drop Problem. By Rob on February 9, 2009. A problem with the Sieg X2 mini-mill [HF 44991, Grizzly G8689, Micro-Mark & others] is that the head can suddenly drop down while you're milling.

                            This package includes everything you need to tram your mini mill and square your vise. Mount the indicator on the universal arm, put the shank of the universal arm in a drill chuck, and check the four corners of your mill table. Adjust the tram by shimming under the base of the column.
