                            Like the heavy-media vessels, Heavy-media Cyclones also are designed to clean coal and minerals based on their density differences. Using finely ground magnetite and water as the media to create a buoyancy effect for gravimetric separation, the Heavy-media Cyclone forces the lighter solids to its centre, where the slurry transports them upward and through the vortex finder.
