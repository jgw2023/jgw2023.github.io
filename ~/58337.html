                            Cone crushers are used by both aggregate producers and the mining industry. The purpose of using crushers is to reduce the particle size of rock materials or to liberate valuable minerals from ores. A tremendous amount of material is crushed yearly by cone crushers. Despite this

                            All jaw crushers reduce large sized rocks, ore, or other material by a compression action. A fixed jaw, mounted in a V-shaped alignment, is the stationary breaking surface, while a movable, "swing" jaw exerts force on the feed material by pushing it against the stationary plate.

                            A Jaw Crusher uses compressive force for breaking material. This mechanical pressure is achieved by the crusher's two jaws dies, one of which is stationary and the other is movable. These two vertical manganese jaw dies create a V-shaped cavity called the crushing chamber, where the top of the crushing chamber is larger than the bottom.

                            Apr 28, 2017 · The maximum distance from which the feed material should fall from into the top of a small to mid-size cone crusher is 3 ft. When the feed material drops from a much greater distance, the stones tend to slam into the V-shaped crushing cavity with such velocity that it subjects the crusher to shock loads and extremely high stress levels.
