                            Should Customers Choose Used Rolling Mill? - Steel Rolling .
                            In the entire rolling mill market, used rolling mills occupy a large share, because its price is relatively low, which just meets the needs of those customers who are unwilling to invest more to purchase new rolling mill equipment. However, second-hand rolling mills cannot be purchased blindly, and a slight inattention will threaten their own interests.

                            Rolling (metalworking) - Wikipedia
                            Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as slabs, blooms, and billets.
