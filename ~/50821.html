                            The Falcon UF Gravity Concentrator. The "UF" or Ultra Fine Gravity Concentrator solves a very specific fine gold recovery problem, and does it very well. Some gold ores contain carbon which can interfere with the leaching process, so flotation is used to remove the carbon before leaching.

                            Gold centrifugal concentrator is useful in the gold recovery in all ranges of particle size. It is most especially useful for recovering fine gold which gets lost during the operation of gravity concentrators. The application has shown that the recovery of gold can be very high, as much as 99% and the concentration ratio is up to 1,000 times.
