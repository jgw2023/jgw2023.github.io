                            For many years, hydrocyclones, commonly referred to as cyclones, have been extensively utilized in the classification of particles in comminution circuits. The practical range of classification for cyclones is 40 microns to 400 microns, with some remote applications as fine as 5 microns or as coarse as 1000 microns. Cyclones are used in both primary and secondary grinding circuits as well as .
