                            Abstract. The influence of skin pass rolling on tensile and microstructural properties of three industrial grade steels was investigated. Skin pass rolling was performed on a laboratory mill equipped with a device designed to reproduce the effects of sheet tension and with load cells aimed at measuring the main working parameters.

                            As with our standard 20-High cluster mills, this Skinpass mill uses a small work roll concept to allow for a high contact pressure in along a small working area. Thus the overall size and strength of the mill is reduced compared to a conventional 2-High or 4-High of the same width range. Main Advantages of the Sendzimir ZH Skinpass Mill
