                            Hammer mill - Wikipedia
                            A hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works was a workshop in the pre-industrial era that was typically used to manufacture semi-finished, wrought iron products or, sometimes, finished agricultural or mining tools, or military weapons. The feature that gave its name to these workshops was the water-driven trip hammer, or set of hammers, used in the process.

                            The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones. It is designed to be more reliable, and is also claimed to be much cheaper and more energy efficient than regular hammermills.

                            This Cold Stone Creamery is located within downtown Mill Creek. Compared to the other ice cream shops of this chain, I would say this particular place is below average for cleanliness. When we visited, the floor was sticky and there were trash left on the tables. However, their ice cream is decent, on par with all the other places I have been to.
