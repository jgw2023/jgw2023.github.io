                            The range of SKIOLD Roller/Crusher Mills supplied by Danagri-3S comprises 4 basic models with 2 or 3 driven rollers, variable sized motors and different capacities. All have reduced noise levels and the outlet heights on each of the models in the range are adjustable. The reason why SKIOLD offer either 2 or 3 roller mills is because some ingredients require different settings.

                            A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.

                            HPGR High Pressure Grinding Rolls
                            HPGR or high-pressure grinding rolls have made broad advances into nonferrous metal mining. The technology is now widely viewed as a primary milling alternative, and there arc a number of large installations commissioned in recent years. After these developments, an HPGR based circuit configuration would often be the base case for certain ore types, such as very hard, abrasive ores.
