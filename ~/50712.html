                            Mitsui is still the largest coal-mining company in Japan, though the organization's overall size was much reduced in 1950 by the forced spin-off of its metal mines into a separate company, Mitsui Mining & Smelting Company, and by the relative insignificance of coal in Japan's current energy strategy.
