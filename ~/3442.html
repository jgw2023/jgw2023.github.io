                            Feb 21, 2019 · Found this drill press at the local scrap yard. It looks like it has been outside for a while, quill doesn't actually move down but spins freely. The belt for the motor is really beefy not a standard v belt. The drill is 3phase 3/4 hp motor, but I can't find a frame designation. I was thinking if the motor was toast I could just throw a single phase on it and well there ya go.

                            We all know Miller makes the best welder in the world. Snap-0n, Mac, Matco, etc. makes a good wrench. I am going to buy a drill press and my research hasn't produced any results on a high quality drill press. Delta, JET, Dayton, Grizzly, Rockwell any others? In your opinion what's the best drill press out there?
