                            DEVELOPMENT OF AN ELECTRICALLY OPERATED CASSAVA .
                            The development and construction of an electrically operated cassava peeling and slicing machine was described in this paper. The objective was to design, construct and test an electrically operated machine that will peel and slice cassava root into chips, to aid the processes of drying, pelletizing and storage.
