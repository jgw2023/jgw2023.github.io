                            Mining processes produce toxic waste that can result in acid mine drainage and groundwater contamination. Niton analyzers effectively perform "double-duty" when used to monitor elemental contaminants in soil, sediments, and tailings at mine sites and in waste streams, in addition to exploration and mining applications.
