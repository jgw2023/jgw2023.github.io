                            Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills, for grinding wheat or other grains.. Millstones come in pairs. The base or bedstone is stationary. Above the bedstone is the turning runner stone which actually does the grinding. The runner stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the "scissoring" or grinding action of the stones.
