                            May 09, 2018 · Preparing the ferrite is mainly reduced to making sure it is as fine as possible and lump free. You can put it through a fine sieve if you like but the powder from the hardware or art store is usually good enough. The one massive problem with iron oxide in powder form is that the particles usually refuse to get wet or accept any "glue" coating".
