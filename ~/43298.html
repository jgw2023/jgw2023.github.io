                            Celadon Ru Kiln Gaiwan - TeaChat
                            Aug 18, 2010 · The shop doesn't sell Taiwan Ru Kiln as they said it is harder to sell, so basically they are selling only China Ru Kiln.-I was offered to try a Ru Kiln cup vs Porcelain cup. According to them, Ru Kiln cup will make the drink smoother and reduces the bitterness. So they gave me raw Pu erh to try. Frankly, I cannot feel a big difference in both.

                            The Yilan Brick Kiln was originally established as Chen He Cheng Kiln Factory. It was later changed to Yilan Brick Kiln and ended its operation in the 1980s. In 1999, the Yilan County Government planned to build residential buildings within the area. However, after various oppositions from the local residents, the kiln was finally preserved.
